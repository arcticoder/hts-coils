hts-coils v2.1.0 â€” Validated high-field REBCO HTS coil optimization

Summary:
- Validated multi-physics HTS coil optimization framework (electromagnetic, thermal, mechanical).
- Multi-backend FEA support: FEniCSx + COMSOL with analytic fallback.
- High-field configuration validated: 7.07 T (89-tape conductor), 0.16% ripple, 74.5 K thermal margin.
- Manuscript fixes, reproducibility improvements (Docker, reproduction scripts), and completed `docs/TODO.ndjson` tasks.

Assets included: manuscript TeX source and TODO list. See Zenodo data DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.17033655 for full datasets.

Notes:
- This release is created as a draft. Publish when ready.
