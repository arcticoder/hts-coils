Warp Soliton Research Module

This module contains preliminary work on Lentz hyperfast solitons,
building on HTS coil optimizations for exotic plasma confinement.

Modules:
    soliton_plasma: Plasma physics simulations for warp field effects
    field_enhancement: Advanced HTS coil configurations for >10T fields
    metrics: Alcubierre-type spacetime metric calculations
    
Research Timeline: September 10 - October 30, 2025
